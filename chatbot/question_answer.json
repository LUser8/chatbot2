  {
    "question": "What are frames and scripts in “Artificial Intelligence”?",
    "answer": "Frames are a variant of semantic networks which is one of the popular ways of presenting non-procedural knowledge in an expert system. A frame which is an artificial data structure is used to divide knowledge into substructure by representing “stereotyped situations’. Scripts are similar to frames, except the values that fill the slots must be ordered.  Scripts are used in natural language understanding systems to organize a knowledge base in terms of the situation that the system should understand."
